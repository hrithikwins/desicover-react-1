the quality of our relationships, professional life, self growth, all comes in growth

- purpose
Is the purpose for everyone the same, or depends on who you are
 ON one level it's same and other level it's idffeerent, we all are looking for happiness, and no matter what we have as our goal, we want some happiness in our lives, we are confused about our goals, suppose we are in a soccer game, the goals are different for the two teams and we have clear goals, but if they are removed, what is the goal then?
 The main goal for our self is to be the best version of ourself, the creation is private to the mortal and immortal perfection, take it to that ultimate perfection, the autopilot in our soul tells us to be better student,doctor, child, human being
 So, our one goal is to be tthe best version of ourself, we want to see that our work is amking thee differnece, we havee see nthe story of the woodcutter to cut 400 per day, another man told him that he would get 800 per day, the condition was that he will have to cut the tree with the round side of the axe, the woodcutter refused, but the man said that he'll get double the salary for the same thing, then he agreed..
 After a week he came and threw the axe at the researcher's feet and told that I want the chips to fly
 This tells that we want to do the best of what we have done
 This means that fun is important in our life,
 No two trees are alike, no two trees are alike, and the biometrics of the tree are same
